            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Coruncopia, a roguelike action-adventure game about a powerful old druid who must defend his world against invaders from a dark realm.</p>
            <p>One fine morning, the sky cracked. From the void fell a palace which would leave an impact on the world of Coruncopia far greater than what the shudders from its landing would suggest. As all manner of horrible abominations spilled forth from its walls across the four corners of the world, it was clear that Coruncopia was in danger. A lone farmer, the ancient druid Nil, boldly approaches the dark, alien palace to greet these unprecedented visitors...and to learn the truth of their wicked motives.</p>
            <p>The spirit of Coruncopia lends itself to a mixture of classical gaming with many gameplay mechanics that have become modern mainstays. The game world creates itself as you play through it, and the nature of its growth will be based on the various abilities you get during your playthrough. Everything from enemy spawns, dungeon layouts, puzzles, and the spells you acquire themselves is pseudorandom. All of this is blended together to create a tailored, hand-crafted experience each time you play. Planning to memorize layouts and enemy locations? I think not.
